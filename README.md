# D4GlyphNodeCalculator
 Requirements: Python 3.10+
 
Description: I was tired of manually calculating the glyph nodes so I made a simple calculator to do it for me. Simple program with a GUI for ease of use.

How to use: Simply count the ammount of nodes within the radius and input the ammount into the respective entry boxes, and also you can input the percentage the glyph node says on it and it will calculate the total percentage it will buff after taking into account the total stat points.

About me: I'm a self tought programmer and have been using python off and on over the years for simple projects for myself.

This github repo has the source code, and two build versions Portable and Desktop where portable is a single EXE.

Used Python Modules:
    -CustomTkinter (More modern looking version of tkinter)
    -AutoPyToExe (to build the executable)
